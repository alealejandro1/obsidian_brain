## The Alignment Problem 
by Brian Christian
Read in 2022

### Good:
Interesting mix of psychology and reinforcement learning
Basic understanding of data science needed to get the full value
Good points on what can go wrong when making decisions using models (e.g. predicting disease)

### Bad:
Very focused on reinforcement learning 
Historical approach is fun to follow, but not the way to learn

## Work Clean
by Dan Charnas
Read in 2022

###Good:
Very interesting first chapter on studying to be a chef at the CIA
Learn about the benefits of keeping your space ultra clean and tidy at all times
In digital sense, close all the apps and tabs you are not using
When collaborating, reply with acknowledgement of what you are expected to do. Expect the same from others.
Setting up systems is easy, maintaining them is hard

###Bad:
The book could have been 3-4 chapters. Most of it is fluff and stretches some points to ridiculousness  ("pro-tip: use 2 hands to empty the dishwasher")
Some of the digital advice is for old people who are not very familiar with computers
The stories get old very fast
