## The Alignment Problem 
by Brian Christian
Read in 2022

### Good:
Interesting mix of psychology and reinforcement learning
Basic understanding of data science needed to get the full value
Good points on what can go wrong when making decisions using models (e.g. predicting disease)

### Bad:
Very focused on reinforcement learning 
Historical approach is fun to follow, but not the way to learn
