In Investments Pick 2: Low Risk, High Return or Liquidity
**liquidity premium** : What investment firms pay you so you are encouraged not to touch your investment in the short run

**Cash management accounts/Money market funds:**

**What they are**: Cash accounts where you can put your money in the short-term. Usually offered by robo-advisors, new fintech solutions and brokerages. They’re marketed as safer investment options and are highly liquid. You are able to withdraw your money in a matter of days or even hours.

The trade-off? Returns.

At the time of publication, returns range from around 1.5% to 2.8% for solutions with similar low-risk levels

**High-yield savings accounts**

**What they are**: Bank accounts with accelerated savings rates that reward you for transacting more with them. This includes salary crediting, card usage, and even investments and insurance.

High-yield savings accounts are also marketed as safe and are also highly liquid.

Their returns aren’t also super high but can be higher than a cash management account – provided you transact enough with the bank.

-   At the time of publication, a realistic return rate ranges from 1% to 3%. can even go up to 4+%, if you transact more with the bank.

## **Instruments that are not liquid, have low risk and higher returns**

**CPF Special Account (SA)**

**What this is**: A mandatory savings account set up by the Singapore government designed to provide you payouts when you retire.

For the longest time, CPF SA’s 4% was considered a super high interest rate for an instrument that is one of the safest available to Singaporeans.

This was particularly true in a low-interest rate world (2008- 2021, RIP).

The trade-off? Liquidity. You can only withdraw your CPF monies at age 55.

-   Still 4% p.a at the time of publication.

**Longer term endowments**

**What it is:** A type of savings plan offered by insurers that have lock-in periods of 10 years or longer. Also offers insurance coverage.

These plans are considered safer and less volatile than assets such as equities, yet they also offer higher returns compared to money market funds and cash management accounts.

Generally, the longer the lock-in period, the higher the return.

-   Generally, long-term endowments return anywhere from 2-5% p.a., though a portion of the returns is not always guaranteed. (As interest rates rise, they might increase as well. They will generally always offer you higher than shorter-term options.)

## **Instruments that are somewhat liquid, have high risk and potentially high returns**

**Stocks, Unit Trusts and ETFs**

**Stocks** are tiny pieces of public companies that you can buy online. These include popular names like Apple, Tesla, Google, and Microsoft.

**Unit trusts** are any type of fund that comprises of a portfolio of various investment instruments like stocks and bonds and is managed by a professional. This could be an individual or an organisation like an asset management company.

ETFs are similar to Unit Trusts, but they are traded on the market. Hence the name, **Exchange** Traded Fund.

Commonly known ETFs are STI-ETF and SPY, CSPX, IVV, ARKK-ETF, QQQ.

These financial instruments all have the potential to earn higher returns than everything listed here.

Case in point: The five-year return of the QQQ ETF is 77% at the time of writing, or a whopping 43.5% p.a at the time of writing.

But of course, high returns are matched by high risks. QQQ is now down 30% from its peak. There are no guaranteed results here. As they say, past performance is not indicative of future results.

-   Huge range of performance
-   A wide range of ETFs can be found on Tiger Brokers.

PS: We say these are ‘somewhat’ liquid, because even though you can sell off these instruments relatively quickly, you might make a loss due to the volatility of these assets.

Let’s go back to the definition of liquidity, especially the words in bold. This investment can be quickly converted into cash **without affecting its value.**
