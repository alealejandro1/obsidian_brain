Queen Charlotte Track was main event. The track starts out very difficult and gets easier progressively. If not used to hiking, expect a speed of 2-3km/h and take note it gets dark faster inside the forest. If sunset is at 7, it'll be dark by 6 inside the forest.

Below is itinerary planned before trip::
