## Laguna Los Tres

Hiking up to Laguna Los Tres took about 10.5 hours roundtrip. This is:
	4.5 hours up
	1.5 hours rest at the summit
	4.5 hours down

Note that of the 10km path, the first 8km are the easiest. 
Path to Laguna Capri starts steep, but quickly becomes more horizontal. Kilometers 4-8 are a breeze.
Last 2km are very uphill and steep, through rocks after POINCENOT camp. This is the most challenging part of the hike. Coming down is also very challenging.

## Chalten City
Very small city. Accomodation is poor quality and expensive.
