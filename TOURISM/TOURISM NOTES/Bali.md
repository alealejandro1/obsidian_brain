So this is my take on planning a trip to Bali. Trip was done in April 2022, so right after reopening from Covid. About 50-70% of Bali seemed operational. Masks were suggested in most places, but clearly only a must in few places only. 

  

Areas of Bali

* Bali has many beaches but many are not "nice", meaning beaches that are not meant for sunbathing and bathing. Best beach for bathing is Nusa Dua, near the airport. Go Nusa Dua for a typical beach holiday.

* Bali has many beautiful Villas, these are large mansions/homes you can rent. They typically will have someone living in the compound that can clean and prepare simple meals for you (e.g. Mie Goreng). Also can provide you with laundry services and items you need like bottle opener or beers. 

* Bali is huge, the roads are bad and there is traffic. If this sounds bad to you, consider staying near the area of interest. So if you want to do lots of beach, stay near Nusa Dua beach. Staying in Ubud and thinking of "going to the beach for a while" is not a great idea, as it is a 1 hour journey each way.

* Ubud area is very natury and has a nice downtown. Staying near Ubud Palace provides access to many spas, restaurants and shops. Consider this if you want to have the option to walk to places, most times you'll need to commute by car if not. Great restaurant in the area is Indus.

* Areas like Jimbaran have nice hotel/villas are near the airport and have decent beaches. I stayed in a beautiful villa (Villa Ken within the Karma complex) and it was fancy and lovely. Walking distance from a small mall that provided some restaurants, an ATM and some snacks. Beaches in Jimbaran are more family oriented, the sand is OK and the water is full of coral debri which does not deliver a very good experience.

* Uluwatu is south of the island and is famous for surfing. We stayed in a beautiful $ hotel (Anantara) which was very nice, but had NOTHING walking distance. Also some areas will not allow ride-sharing and deliveries, such as Grab/GoJek.

* Seminyak and Kuta are totally different animals. Here is for beaches and party, many great clubs for loud dancing and stag parties. We visited restaurant/club "Mexicola" which featured very good mexican food and people dancing. Take note, lots of drunken (and sometimes rude) Australians are in the whereabouts. 

  

Spas & Massage

The Spas and massage options in Bali are amazing and affordable. You can get many types for a wide variety of costs. Rule of thumb is that whatever service you get in your hotel will be more expensive than if you find a standalone spa outside the hotel. 

* Taksu spa near Ubud palace was very good.

* Casa spa is further out from central Ubud, but more beautiful.

* You can also get a spa delivered to your room (the masseuse will come in a scooter). However, getting a massage in a normal bed is not as nice.

  

How to Pack

Bali is not formal. You can go almost anywhere in flip-flops or sandals. 

Bali is hot/humid most of the time, especially during day time, so be prepared to have well ventilated clothes.

A particular combo for girls is to wear swimsuits that can be worn with a dress to cover enough to walk around the city or go to a restaurant. 

For guys you can wear shorts and t-shirt/polo everywhere. You can wear shorts and a shirt for a nicer looking outfit with sneakers, but that's about as fancy as it gets. Potentially clubs will have higher standard (e.g. long pants and shoes for men). I went to mexicola with shorts and flip flops, no issue.

Although locals dress modestly, foreigners dress with as much or as little clothing as you can imagine. If you are not visiting any temples, feel free to wear anything you want. Same applies to swimwear.

  

Temples

Temples in Bali are commonplace (every few houses literally you'll see shrines). The famous temples will require you to wear a Sarong (male and female). If you want to play it safe you might need to cover your shoulders too, but that was not a must in Uluwatu Cliff temple (just sarong which is free with entrance fee).

  

Communication and ride-hailing

Grab and Go-Jek are the big apps for transportation and delivery of food and groceries. Set them up before flying in.

* We got pharmacy items, beer, meals and dessert delivered to our villa, but SOME accommodations do not allow for this. Check first.

* Locations (e.g. Uluwatu) that don't allow ride hailing usually help you connect with a driver that will negotiate a price with you (more expensive than apps). For short rides, this will be overpriced (like 2x the price in Grab/GoJek), but for longer trips (1+ hour) price might be similar to the apps.

  

Things to do

Beaches, Pools and fancy restaurants

Bali is mostly hindu and the tourist attractions feature the story of Rama, Sita and the attempts of a demon to steal here. Kecac Dance @ uluwatu temple and Gamelan + dance @ ubud palace feature the same story, but in different interpretations. Both are entertaining and affordable.

* Kecac Dance in Uluwatu Temple is VERY good (need to pay entrance fee to temple AND show fee)

* Ubud Palace offers a performative dance with the live traditional band (Gamelan)

* Water sports were underwhelming (short length and not very "daring"). Scuba diving is a good experience for total beginners, but the water is not clear at all.

  

Food

* There are many types of restaurants across Bali, but you might need to commute to find what you want.

* Many hotels/accommodations might be a bit basic, typically leaning to 2 flavors: "Indonesian" and "Western". Western typically involves fried eggs, sausages and extremely basic toast. Indonesian is typically Mie Goreng (noodles stir fried with eggs, meat and vegetables). Mie Goreng can be made vegetarian by not stir frying in the meat and eggs.

  

Alcohol

* Liquor is expensive, consider stocking up in the airport for nice whiskey or the type

* Bintang beer (local brand) is cheaper than any other brand, so you might want to buy a lot of beer if you are staying in a villa. Is virtually impossible to get drunk on Bintang, as it only has 4% alcohol content.

  

Payments

* 3/4 places will take a credit card, sometimes with a 1-4% fee. AMEX was accepted maybe 1/3 times.

* ATMs are available in many places, but don't always work. 

* Good to carry at least 200-400 SGD in cash as there will be tipping expected for masseuses or other services (not restaurants).

* If you need to pay for a visa on arrival, you might need to use cash. There are ATMs in the airport.

  

Key takeaways for future visits:

* **Plan geographically in advance for locations and areas of interest.** Bali is large and commuting is not pleasant. Is not expensive to use ride-hailing and it comes fast. But there is traffic and it is less fun to grab around for 30-45min. 

* **Remote villas are great and cheap, but don't expect to have access to ride-hailing or many options**. Consider stacking up provisions and spending 2 nights in a nice villa (e.g. outside Ubud) and then get out of the area.

* **There will be ants and lizards and frogs**. Most places. Frogs can be loud at night, even in fancy hotels.

* **Bali is safe**. Tourists are the main source of income and they are appreciated. Avoid being too drunk outside and you will be fine. Use common sense. A thank you or please goes a long way.

* **All hotels and villas have safes.** Make sure to check they are working properly the moment you check-in. Make sure at least some of your bags have TSA locks, so you can lock them while being away.
