## Glaciar Perito Moreno
Used Patagonia Chic company (~270 SGD for 2 pax) for a ice walking, navigation and boardwalk tour. They pick you up at hotel and return you back to it. Starts 7am and ends by 5pm (back in hotel).

## Nothing much more to do
Calafate is nice overall, but doesn't have anything really cool to do outside the glacier. Just like the [[Iguazu]] waterfalls, one full day for excursion is enough.

# Some prices
