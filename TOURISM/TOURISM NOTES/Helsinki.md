A few weeks ago we spent about 8 nights in Finland. We managed to visit its capital, Helsinki, and some other cities in the north. What follows are some key information that may be of use to any traveller. We visited during summer (August 2018) so the weather was usually warm and pleasant.

  

Currency and Money:

Finland uses euros and is an EXPENSIVE country for european standards. It is hard to find ATMs but they are certainly not needed since EVERYTHING can be paid with credit card. This includes the shops on the city market. Like the guy who rented our car 'The guy selling sausages in the middle of the forest, will have the machine to pay with card. Welcome to Finland'.

  

Restaurants and food:

A meal in a restaurant could go from 10eu to 20eu. Something with reindeer or moose could easily go up to 30eu. To me, reindeer tasted much like beef, so after paying extra to try, I switched back to Lamb and Beef.

Something of note is that how good the restaurant looked or its location, was not always an indication of how expensive it was. This meant that some very central and beautiful restaurants will offer hamburgers with fries for about 10+ eu, or that average restaurants will charge 15-20eu for so-so stuff. So always check the menu before deciding to sit. 

  

Accommodation: 

We sourced all our stays from Booking.com. It's worth noting that Finland is EXPENSIVE, so when looking for places to stay in Helsinki, don't be surprised to pay well over 100eu per night. 

The first night we stayed in a very old hotel near the train station (Hotel Arthur), the place was very simple and old, amazing breakfast, but completely unimpressive. We paid about 150eu for a night. On the way back, we stayed on the Hotel Indigo. For only 20eu more, we had a 4-star stay in a very nice part of town (about 15min away from the train station) with a beautiful bed and great amenities overall. 

When visiting cities in the area of Lapland, the prices were significantly lower, since it was summer (no snow) and accommodations were about 40% cheaper.

Definitely the best place we stayed, but the one furthest from Helsinki, was the Wilderness Hotel & Igloos Inari. We only paid 99eu for an amazing room, the amenities were fantastic. We experienced the white nights there, where darkness never comes since there is always light. 

In our experience the breakfasts were always insane buffet style with many types of cheese, salmon, jams, waffles and many many more things. 

  

People:

Finnish people are extremely friendly when engaged and will speak in a very candid and straightforward way. Everyone speaks perfect english, although amongst themselves they will speak finnish. 

  

Roads: 

We rented a car in the city of Rovaniemi (we booked it online and we picked it up from Rovaniemi train station). Its important to note that the E75 highway is wide-enough for 1 lane each way. To overtake cars, you need to be using the lane of the cars going the other way. There are no divisions other than the yellow/white line. 

Its important to note that we tried OTHER routes between Inari and Rovaniemi, besides the E75. This ones were not wide enough for 2 cars at the same time, the lines were blurred or non-existent and plenty of dirt roads. 

The roads were mostly empty. However we ran into moose and reindeer on several occasions. The animals are absolutely not scared, or impressed, by the cars and will act as if they were the only beings on the road. Since some moose can weight up to 700kg, hitting them with the car at high speed can be deadly not only for the animal, but for the people in the car. 

The combination of animals crossing the road virtually anywhere and the narrowness of the road itself made the trip back from Inari to Rovaniemi a stressful experience.  

So please stay on the E75. It only gets worse than that.

  

Things we did in Helsinki:

HAM - Helsinki art museum was good value for money. Lots of graffiti and trains exhibitions.

Finnish Museum of Photography - Interesting but bad value since it was very small and very much out of town. 

Market Square - Near the water, great market area. Good to find places to drink. You can take the ferry to Suomenlinna.

Suomenlinna - Is a sea fortress about 15min away by boat from Helsinki. Its a very nice half-day outing. Note that its free to enter and walk around, however the few restaurants/cafes available are EXPENSIVE even for finnish standards, so definitely head there with a full stomach and aim to get a beer from the brewery or pack some lunch/drinks. 

  

Night Train:

To travel between Helsinki and Rovaniemi we booked a room in the Night Train. The berth (room) has bunk beds (for 2 people) and a small sink. There are bathrooms and even showers available for common use, but with lock (key). It was an interesting experience, however it is not cheap at all. We spent about 500eu for rountrip. It was cheaper than paying for 2 nights + 2 roundtrip flights, but barely.
