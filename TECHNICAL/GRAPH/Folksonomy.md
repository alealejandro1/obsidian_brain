Definition from https://cdn.odi.org/media/documents/7123.pdf

A folksonomy can be defined as a classification system that maximises the opportunities provided by the new web technology associated with web 2.0 and cloud computing (Lambe, 2007). The term was coined in 2004 in an attempt to define the process through which users owned and tagged the content of social networking websites such as Facebook with their own words, rather than website hosts deciding categories. 

A folksonomy therefore refers to the act of tagging documents, or pictures, for example in Flickr or Picasa, blog entries in Blogger or Knowledge taxonomies - A literature review 5 Wordpress, videos in Vimeo or YouTube or individual tags in delicious.com, etc; in other words, when it is left to individuals and not associated with a predetermined classification and the formal rules that go with a tradition

# Why consider:
For ever growing list of items, is it possible to have a fixed system ruled by 1 given person? probably not.
