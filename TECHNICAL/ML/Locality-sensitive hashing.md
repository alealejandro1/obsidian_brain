# Wikipedia definition of LSH:
**locality-sensitive hashing** (**LSH**) is an algorithmic technique that hashes similar input items into the same "buckets" with high probability.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing#cite_note-MOMD-1) (The number of buckets is much smaller than the universe of possible input items.)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing#cite_note-MOMD-1) Since similar items end up in the same buckets, this technique can be used for [data clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis "Cluster analysis") and [nearest neighbor search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search "Nearest neighbor search"). It differs from [conventional hashing techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function "Hash function") in that [hash collisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_collision "Hash collision") are maximized, not minimized. Alternatively, the technique can be seen as a way to [reduce the dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_reduction "Dimension reduction") of high-dimensional data; high-dimensional input items can be reduced to low-dimensional versions while preserving relative distances between items.
