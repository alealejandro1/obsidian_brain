# Risks regarding taxonomies:
https://cdn.odi.org/media/documents/7123.pdf
Another risk commonly associated with taxonomies is that they do not have the flexibility required to adapt to changes within the organisation. This issue can arise when the key roles and responsibilities necessary to develop and maintain the taxonomies are not defined carefully when a taxonomy is planned (Hedden, 2010).

There are also risks linked to the decision to develop a corporate taxonomy, in both large and small organisations (Hedden, 2010; Lambe, 2007). Management should consider carefully whether to design a single rigid taxonomy or several taxonomies that cover different areas of work and associated knowledge. The aim is to avoid excessive rigidity, which will undermine cooperation and sharing. Hunter (ND) argues that, when several taxonomies coexist, they organise different areas of knowledge and lead to creative improvements in the organisation. 

Given the risks described here, rather than aiming at absolute consistency, standardisation and tidiness, taxonomists should seek the consistency and standardisation necessary for effective sharing and retrieval of data and information (Lambe, NDb). Keeping in mind that flexibility is an important characteristic of taxonomies, the next section illustrates how different types of taxonomies are defined by different purposes.

# Kinds of taxonomies
* Lists ~ basic but quickly goes crazy
* Trees ~ resemble way of categorizing and sub categorizing
* Hierarchy  ~ trees with predictable and consisten levels, like a pyramid
* Polyhierarchies ~ entail many connections between categories and words
* Matrices ~ organised based on dimensions on axis, like periodic table of elements
* Facets ~  system allowed books to be classified according to five different categories, which he called facets: main topic; things the book talks about; action discussed in the book; localisation in the book; and chronology covered in the book. Each book is therefore classified according to five mini taxonomies, and can be identified from different searching points
