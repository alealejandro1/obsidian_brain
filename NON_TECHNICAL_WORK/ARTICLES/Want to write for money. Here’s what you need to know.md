**Hot tip:** If you duke it out with the people on [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/) purely on cost, you’re never going to get any gigs. There are writers in the Philippines who can charge a fraction of what you do.

Instead, the jobs I would focus on are either: 

-   The ones that require localised knowledge of the Singapore market.  
    
-   Writing gigs that require high trust; the ones that are so important for the client that they can’t risk outsourcing to some unknown person overseas. These could be urgent work, or highly technical work. Basically, lots of responsibility involved.
