Main points:
* 1 Hexagon ~ 6 miles or whatever is 1 day of travel through a difficult terrain
* If following a nice road, 1 day travel ~ 3 hexagons
* Use hexagons to manage time and weather
* Add interest points to certain hexagons using random encounter tables
* Random Encounter tables should be related to type of terrain or certain events, so there is flavor in addition to randomness
* Rolling random encounter twice could be "You ran into a herbalist, who is fighting with a forest monster"
* Good to take basic locations and play out the aftermath of a double random encounter "You encounter a destroyed hut, claws from what could've been a wyvern make a hole in the ceiling"
* Hexagon doesn't replace an overarching main plot. It fleshes the body in between main events.
