Backstory:

Younger Koto started out his life as a Goliath, living in the mountains with his family. He was curious about arcana and eager to learn about mysteries of the universe beyond his simple life in nature. Against the advice of his family he set out to track a solitaire Warlock passing through his mountain village. He was sure this wise Warlock would help him understand more about the world.

After days of tracking in the lonely mountains, Koto found the Warlock. The Warlock saw no danger in young Koto and decided to entertain his questions for his own amusement. He invited Koto to join him in by his campfire.

After a few rounds of questions and answers, the Warlock decided to produce an ancient Eldritch tome to 'help' answer Koto's questions. Upon starting to read the tome, Koto's mind saw terrible things. He could suddenly hear, terrible voices whispering in a language that he suddenly was able to comprehend (Infernal). 

Koto dropped the book and ran away, the Warlock cackling in the back, his laughter echoing through the snowy mountain top. Koto kept running, while his ears could sense that other terrible laughters, of what seemed like otherworldy beings, were joining the Warlock.

This event darkened Koto's views of the world. Even once back in the safety of his village and family, he was still uneasy. The concert of terrible laughters still ringing in his mind, images he will never forget. Koto could only find respite when deep in nature where he could cast the terrible thoughts aside while immersing himself in the elements, plant and animals of the mountains.

Koto decided to become a Druid, as a way to cleanse his mind and protect the only thing he sees as pure. Nature. So far, it hasn't been going well for him. But he can live and that's something.
