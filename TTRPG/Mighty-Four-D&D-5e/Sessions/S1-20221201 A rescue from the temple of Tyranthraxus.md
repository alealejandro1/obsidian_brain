**Adventure:**

1.  **First Scene: Meeting [[Mainara]]:**

Party starts in the city of [[Waterdeep]], running out of $ as usual

Meet [[Mainara]] Caffield, who is staying a the Mushy Goat Tavern (by the entrance of [[Waterdeep]])

[[Mainara]] and her colleague [[Anwyn]] were attacked by Goblins, [[Anwyn]] was captured and [[Mainara]] escaped

[[Mainara]] and [[Anwyn]] are ancient religion researchers at the university of Candlekeep

[[Anwyn]] is a freckled white-blond hairish researcher in her late 60s

[[Mainara]] offers 500gp/each if we bring [[Anwyn]] alive, 250gp/each if we find her dead. [[Isoza]] negotiates with [[Mainara]], so she grants us 25gp/each as a starting point.

[[Koto]] heals wounded [[Mainara]] as a token of good faith.

**Second Scene: Finding the Goblins**

After a long rest and walking for a day, the party finds the area where the goblins attacked the researchers

Finding small animal traps along the way, the party finds the entrance to a cavern on the face of the mountain

There are ornately carved walls that have been eroded by time and theft. Goblins riding wolves patrol the outside.

Party sneaks by aggresive goblins on the outside and make its way into the hallways of the temple

The sneaking in fails, when the party opens up a room full of angry wolves that bark loudly. After failing to sneak around, a fight starts with goblins from outside the temple and some coming from inside. [[Koto]] smashes 1 goblin with a mace attack, while [[Isoza]] shoots an arrow through the eye of another one. After taking some damage, [[Koto]] interrogates an injured goblin (learning nothing) which he subsequently finishes off. One goblin escapes into the lower levels.

The party investigates a kitchen where [[Isoza]] find a jug of self-refilling soy sauce. “_A magic item no doubt”_ says [[Zuck]]. [[Isoza]] puts it away for now. [[Koto]] finds a bunch of research notes, probably they belong to [[Anwyn]], so he keeps them.

**Third Scene: Lower Levels of the Temple**

The party runs into a group of six gambling goblins. [[Koto]] manages to burn a goblin to death using Bonfire, while [[Isoza]] rages. [[Zuck]] is highly injured, but manages to blow to the brains of a goblin using a ray of frost.

[[Zuck]] falls, but is brought back by Goodberries, allowing him to deliver thunderclap twice before he falls again. [[Isoza]] squishes a goblin with her axe and [[Koto]] smashes the last goblin with his mace. After bringing [[Zuck]] back up again using Goodberries, the party is still severely injured. We decide to take a short rest to recover from our injuries.

**Fourth Scene: Ritual room**

Upon descending to the lowest levels of the eroded temple, the party finds a room with a roaring fire, a bloody altar, goblin remains and a big statue of an evil deity. Also a hobgoblin with a mysterious purple glowing sword and two wolves at his command. In a corner, a gravely injured [[Anwyn]] lies unconscious in a pool of her own blood.

“_More sacrifices for [[Tyranthraxus]]_” says the Hobgoblin before starting to fight [[Zuck]] who had also shifted into a Hobgoblin.

After a taxing battle, [[Zuck]] falls, but after another Goodberry, manages to come back up to deliver thunderclap. Injured by the thunder and bonfires, both wolves are destroyed by [[Koto]] and [[Isoza]] melee attacks. Before [[Zuck]] gives the final blow to the gravely injured Hobgoblin (whose sword has cracked and fully purple glowing), he drives his own sword through his chest “sacrificing himself for [[Tyranthraxus]]”. This triggers the slow collapse of the temple.

[[Isoza]] carries [[Anwyn]] and the party escapes from the temple as it collapses, its entrance dissapearing as if it never existed.

**Conclusion: Reunion with [[Mainara]]**

The party runs straight into town. [[Anwyn]] looks weak, but the party helps her wake up and have a short chat with her to check her story. She was indeed kidnapped by Goblins who surprisingly didn’t take her expensive jewelry or clothing.

After delivering [[Anwyn]] to [[Mainara]], both are very happy to be reunited. The party receives the promised gold (to [[Anwyn]]’s unhappiness) and because of the observations of the temple and the research notes that were returned, both remain amicable with the party. [[Mainara]] shares that [[Tyranthraxus]] is a bad name.

Promises of future adventuring work by the university of Candlekeep is mentioned. [[Mainara]] and [[Anwyn]] will remain a few more days in town recovering before they set their return back to Candlekeep.
