#session 
The party reaches the pouncing Poney.
There [[Sam]] and [[Frodo]] meet a strider that will reveal himself as called [[Aragorn]], nice fellow.

They continue together until they rest atop a mountain where they have the first encounter with the [[Nazgul]] there Frodo gets stabbed but then they get rescued by (in the movie) [[Arwen]] who takes [[Frodo]] back to safety in [[Lothlorien]]
